abstract: "Changes were identified in Peruvian migration to Córdoba (Argentina) in its sociodemographic composition, the importance of networks and their relation to social, economic and political gap between Peru and Argentina. Data were used from the 2001 national census and a specific survey on Peruvians living in Córdoba in 2009. It is found that the city of Córdoba is a consolidated migratory destination for migrants from diverse socioeconomic background, having been primarily a place of higher education reserved for upper-middle classes in Peru. For those who arrived more recently, there has been a rise in the economic integration after the first arrival, which reduces the initial over qualification."
